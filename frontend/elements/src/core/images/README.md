There were some issues with propogating things down the shadow dom
Also couldn't get regular inheritance to work

So the core logic is copy/pasted in each of these
Would be nice to fix, but the API shouldn't change

Despite being WET, this does remove a level of nesting in the DOM
and makes styling debugging slightly easier
