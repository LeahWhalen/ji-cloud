We'll be using Mozilla's Project Fluent for the translation side of localization

# Engineering

Requires that all strings everywhere be written with a function wrapper and some id + optional context

The translation bundles will need to be managed and delivered such that only what's needed is loaded

# Translation

Should take advantage of the adaptable system to provide first-class experiences in the native language.

# Design

We'll need to figure out how to best communicate this. Right to left and different text sizes will change some flow decisions. Some things will need real references, others can be done by explanation
