# Setup

There are many moving parts that need to be configured in order to make it all work together. The required setup is spread across local environment settings, remote secrets, proprietary vendor administration, local configuration, and more.

The subchapters here should point to everything needed to get the project up and running - even in a complete fork.

When there are implementation details (such as _how_ to apply IAM permissions to google, or the permitted values in local files, or guidelines for strong secrets), please consult the additional documentation (e.g. google's documentation,  comments in the settings files, or industry-wide best-practice guidelines)
